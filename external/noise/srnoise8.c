// This function is very similar to "armnoise8", but it adds a
// parameter "alpha" to animate the noise pattern. This happens
// at a small cost in speed, so if you don't want the animation,
// "armnoise8" is slightly faster.
//
// An implementation of 2-D "Simplex Noise" written for 8-bit
// CPUs, in "hardware-tuned C" made to run fast on an ATmega32.
// Intended use cases are low resolution LED array animations
// and procedural sound generation.
// The code should compile and run on any CPU architecture,
// but it was written specifically for the ARM 8-bit architecture,
// using 8-bit arithmetic wherever possible.
// A 16 MHz Arduino Uno or Arduino Micro can churn out around
// 35,000 noise values per second with this, which is enough to do a
// lot of low resolution graphics and at least some sound synthesis.
//
// Speed is a priority here, and the noise quality suffers.
// The 2-D pattern from this function is not as nice as you would
// want for high resolution graphics. It's not "random" enough on
// a larger scale, and quantization effects from 8-bit arithmetic
// are clearly visible if you render this noise as a 2-D image.
// It was made for low-res LED array graphics and sound synthesis.
//
// 8-bit integers use 8.0 or 0.8 bits unsigned representation
// or the "fractional value" 1.7 bits, signed or unsigned.
// The number of 16-bit integers have been kept to a minimum.

// for a quick and dirty rotation of simplex noise gradients for
// "flow noise" in the style of Ken Perlin and Fabrice Neyret.
// The sine/cosine wave period is [0..255] (N.8u binary where N>=0),
// and the output range is -127 to 127 (1.7s representation).
