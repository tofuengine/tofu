# How to contribute

Hi there! Welcome onboard! Well, at least I hope you are reading this file with the intent to be part of the project and contribute to its growth! :)

## Type of Contribution

Fell free to contribute in any way you find suitable for the project, being that in the form of bug fixes, style/typo corrections, examples, or documentation.

Oh, by the way, documentation is split in a [separate repository](https://github.com/tofuengine/tofuengine.github.io). Please, refer to it in case.

## Submitting Changes

Please send a [GitHub Pull Request](https://github.com/tofuengine/tofu/pulls) with a clear list of what you've done (read more about [pull requests](http://help.github.com/pull-requests/)). Please follow our coding conventions (below) and make sure all of your commits are atomic (one feature per commit).

Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:

    $ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
    > 
    > A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."

## Coding conventions

Start reading our code and you'll get the hang of it.

There is also an [additional file](CODING_STYLE.md) annotating some more specific conventions.
